Brief Description

Kernel DM+V (Distribution Modeling + Variance) is an algorithm that treats gas distribution modeling as a density estimation problem. It learns a statistical 2D gas distribution model, uniquely including the variance in addition to the distribution mean, from localized sensor measurements. This capability significantly improves model quality by allowing for the evaluation of model quality in terms of data likelihood. For nanobot swarms, Kernel DM+V creates dynamic gas distribution maps and suggests optimal future measurement locations based on uncertainty, enabling adaptive sampling strategies. This is particularly useful for gas leak detection and environmental monitoring.

Pseudocode Implementation

The Kernel DM+V algorithm computes temporary grid maps for integrated importance weights and weighted readings, then uses these to calculate confidence, mean concentration, and variance maps.

PROCEDURE KernelDMV(Measurements: D_train, GridResolution: c, KernelWidth: sigma, ScalingParameter: sigma_omega)
    // D_train: Set of localized sensor measurements (xi, ri) for training
    // c: Cell size (grid resolution)
    // sigma: Kernel width (parameter for Gaussian weighting function)
    // sigma_omega: Scaling parameter for confidence map

    // Define environment grid based on D_train and c
    Initialize Grid_Cells (k) covering the environment
    Initialize temporary grid maps: Omega_map, R_map, V_map
    Initialize final grid maps: Mean_Concentration_map, Variance_map, Confidence_map

    // Normalize raw sensor readings (if not already normalized)
    // ri = (Ri - min(all_Ri)) / (max(all_Ri) - min(all_Ri))

    // Calculate r0 (average of all sensor readings) and v0 (average of all variance contributions)
    r0 = AVERAGE(all_ri in D_train)
    v0 = AVERAGE((ri - r_predicted_at_xi)^2 for all (xi, ri) in D_train) // Needs initial r_predicted

    // Step 2: Compute temporary grid maps (Omega_map, R_map)
    FOR each cell k in Grid_Cells DO
        Omega_k = 0 // Integrated Importance Weights
        R_k = 0     // Integrated Weighted Readings
        x_k = CenterOfCell(k) // Center coordinate of cell k

        FOR each measurement (xi, ri) in D_train DO
            distance = DISTANCE(xi, x_k)
            weight = GAUSSIAN_WEIGHT(distance, sigma) // N(|xi - xk|, sigma)
            Omega_k = Omega_k + weight
            R_k = R_k + weight * ri
        END FOR
        Omega_map[k] = Omega_k
        R_map[k] = R_k
    END FOR

    // Step 3 & 4: Calculate Confidence Map (alpha_map) and Mean Concentration Estimate (Mean_Concentration_map)
    FOR each cell k in Grid_Cells DO
        Omega_k = Omega_map[k]
        // alpha_k = 1 - e^-(Omega_k)^2 / sigma_omega^2
        alpha_k = CALCULATE_CONFIDENCE(Omega_k, sigma_omega)
        Confidence_map[k] = alpha_k

        IF Omega_k > 0 THEN
            r_k = alpha_k * (R_k / Omega_k) + (1 - alpha_k) * r0
        ELSE
            r_k = r0 // Default to global average if no data
        END IF
        Mean_Concentration_map[k] = r_k
    END FOR

    // Step 5: Calculate Variance Map (Variance_map)
    // This step requires mean predictions (r_k) from the previous step
    FOR each cell k in Grid_Cells DO
        V_k = 0 // Integrated Variance Contributions
        x_k = CenterOfCell(k)

        FOR each measurement (xi, ri) in D_train DO
            distance = DISTANCE(xi, x_k)
            weight = GAUSSIAN_WEIGHT(distance, sigma)
            // r_k_i is the mean prediction of the model for the cell closest to measurement point xi
            r_k_i = Mean_Concentration_map
            V_k = V_k + weight * (ri - r_k_i)^2
        END FOR
        V_map[k] = V_k
    END FOR

    FOR each cell k in Grid_Cells DO
        Omega_k = Omega_map[k]
        alpha_k = Confidence_map[k] // Use pre-calculated confidence

        IF Omega_k > 0 THEN
            v_k = alpha_k * (V_map[k] / Omega_k) + (1 - alpha_k) * v0
        ELSE
            v_k = v0 // Default to global average variance
        END IF
        Variance_map[k] = v_k
    END FOR

    RETURN Mean_Concentration_map, Variance_map, Confidence_map
    END PROCEDURE


  Final Thoughts

Kernel DM+V's ability to model both the mean and variance of gas distributions is a significant advantage for nanobot swarms, as it provides valuable uncertainty estimates. This allows nanobots to implement adaptive sampling strategies by prioritizing areas with high uncertainty to improve mapping accuracy, thereby optimizing their limited sampling points. The algorithm's non-parametric nature means it makes few assumptions about environmental conditions, making it robust for diverse real-world deployments. However, Kernel DM+V requires accurate localization of sensor measurements, which can be challenging for nanobots operating in complex, GPS-denied micro-environments where Brownian motion is significant. The computational demands for real-time mapping can also be high, especially for large environments, necessitating offline training and deployment of lightweight models, similar to DRL approaches, to manage the nanobots' limited onboard computing resources.
