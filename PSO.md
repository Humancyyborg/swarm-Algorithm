2.1. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

Brief Description

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It operates with a population of candidate solutions, called particles, which move through the search space according to their position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its own best-known position (p_best) and the entire swarm's best-known position (g_best), which are updated as better positions are found by any particle. This guidance is expected to move the swarm towards optimal solutions. PSO is a metaheuristic that makes few assumptions about the problem and does not require the optimization problem to be differentiable. For nanobot swarms, robots act as particles, optimizing their position based on local sensor readings, such as odor concentration. It is frequently employed to determine the optimal number and strategic placement of sensors, particularly in large commercial sealed areas. Relevant applications include gas leak detection, search and rescue, and crop monitoring.

Pseudocode Implementation

The basic PSO algorithm aims to minimize a cost function by iteratively updating particle positions and velocities based on individual and global bests.

PROCEDURE ParticleSwarmOptimization(f: cost_function, S: num_particles, MaxIterations: int, w: float, c1: float, c2: float)
    // f: The cost function to minimize (takes a position vector, returns a scalar)
    // S: Number of particles in the swarm
    // MaxIterations: Maximum number of optimization iterations
    // w: Inertia weight (controls influence of previous velocity)
    // c1: Cognitive coefficient (controls influence of particle's best position)
    // c2: Social coefficient (controls influence of global best position)

    // Initialize swarm
    FOR each particle i = 1 to S DO
        Initialize particle's position xi randomly within search space bounds (e.g., U(blo, bup))
        Initialize particle's velocity vi randomly (e.g., U(-vmax, vmax))
        Set particle's best known position pi_best = xi
        Set particle's best known fitness f_pi_best = f(xi)
    END FOR

    // Initialize global best position and fitness
    Set global_best_position g_best = position of particle with best initial fitness
    Set global_best_fitness f_g_best = f(g_best)

    // Optimization loop
    FOR iteration = 1 to MaxIterations DO
        FOR each particle i = 1 to S DO
            // Update velocity
            // r1, r2 are random numbers in [0,1]
            vi = w * vi + c1 * r1 * (pi_best - xi) + c2 * r2 * (g_best - xi)

            // Update position
            xi = xi + vi

            // Evaluate current fitness
            current_fitness = f(xi)

            // Update particle's best position
            IF current_fitness < f_pi_best THEN
                f_pi_best = current_fitness
                pi_best = xi
            END IF

            // Update global best position
            IF current_fitness < f_g_best THEN
                f_g_best = current_fitness
                g_best = xi
            END IF
        END FOR
    END FOR

    RETURN g_best // The best solution found by the swarm
    END PROCEDURE

Final Thoughts

PSO offers an efficient global search capability and adaptability to dynamic environments, making it suitable for nanobot swarms operating in unpredictable settings. Its decentralized nature aligns well with the core principles of swarm intelligence. However, its effectiveness for nanobots can be hampered by the computational overhead required for complex fitness functions, especially given the limited onboard processing power of miniaturized robots. Furthermore, PSO is sensitive to local optima, meaning the swarm might converge to a suboptimal solution if the search space is complex. The algorithm also necessitates communication among particles to share the global best position, which can be challenging for nanobots due to their inherent communication limitations and the "less is more" principle in swarm communication. Careful parameter tuning (e.g., inertia weight, cognitive and social coefficients) is crucial for balancing exploration and exploitation to prevent premature convergence.
